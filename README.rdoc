= Complex Form Examples using unobtrusive jQuery and HTML5

I've added a branch using unobtrusive jQuery and HTML5 to Ryan Bates' solution for multi-model form problem using the latest +accepts_nested_attributes_for+ available in Rails 2.3.

To access it, you'll need to clone the unobtrusive-jquery branch:

  git checkout -b deep origin/unobtrusive-jquery

Once you clone this branch, just run the migrations and start up the server to try it out.

  rake db:migrate
  script/server
