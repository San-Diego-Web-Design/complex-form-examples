= Complex Form Example: Deep Nesting

This solution uses the +accepts_nested_attributes_for+ which was introduced in Rails 2.3. It supports any level of depth in nesting models. This version uses unobtrusive JavaScript with jQuery and HTML 5.

Once you clone this repository, just run the migrations and start up the server to try it out.

  rake db:migrate
  script/server
